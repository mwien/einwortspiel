# Einwortspiel

Multiplayer word game using Elixir, Phoenix and Liveview. 

## Game Idea
Each player receives three words, with two of them being the same for everyone, and describes them by a single clue. Afterwards, they must deduce which word is unique to them based on the clues of the other players. 

You can play the game at [`www.einwortspiel.com`](http://www.einwortspiel.com). 

## To run the game locally

Start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
