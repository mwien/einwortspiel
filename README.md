# Lost In Words

Multiplayer word game using Elixir, Phoenix and Liveview. 

The idea of the game is that every player has the task to describe three words with a single clue. Two of the three words are common to all players. Afterwards the players have to decide which word only they alone have. 

You can play the game [here](http://116.203.183.51:4001/). 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
